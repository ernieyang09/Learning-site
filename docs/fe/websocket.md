# Websocket

WebSocket is a web technology that enables bidirectional, full-duplex communication between client and server over a persistent, single-socket connection.

- websocket is built on TCP


- Server can send data to client without client asking for it.
- It's a stateful communication, so a little bit hard to scale.
- Multiplexing support.
