# What should you consider when you create a FE project from scratch

#### Project Goals and Requirements

I think this is the most important. It tells the story, how long the project will last, how many people will involve in. You should pick a quite suitable decision about the technical decision.

#### Version Control and Repository Setup

Decide on a branching strategy and techinal stack and your project structure.

#### Design system

Do you use any css framework or do you want to create your own typography. Clarify the design system first(if possible).

#### Build and Deployment

Build your CI/CD pipepline

#### Performance Monitoring and Analytics
