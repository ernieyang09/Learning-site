# XSS(Cross-site scripting)

Users to inject malicious scripts into web pages that are viewed by other users. This can lead to the execution of these scripts in the context of a victim's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal information, impersonate users, deface websites, or perform other malicious actions.

It can be triggered automatically

```js
<img src="not_exist" onerror="alert(1)">

// pseudo protocol
<iframe src=javascript:alert(1)></iframe>
```

### case

when updating the password, better ask users typing current password again.

If we only have an updated password column, someone can modify your password directly through xss attack.

### How to prevent

1. sanitization (encode, process html...)

2. CSP(Content Security Policy) restrict script on allowed list
