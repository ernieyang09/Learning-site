# Blockchain note

At the most basic level, blockchain technology is composed of cryptographic algorithms. The goal of the blockchain is to create a distributed, decentralized, and trusted record of the history of the system. The most famous blockchain, Bitcoin, uses this record to store the history of transactions, so people can make and receive payments on the Bitcoin blockchain and trust that their money wonâ€™t be lost or stolen.

### Hash Functions

A hash function is a mathematical function that can take any number as an input and produces an output in a fixed range of numbers. Blockchain relies heavily on secure hash functions to ensure that transactions cannot be modified after being stored in the ledger.

### Block

Block is consist of numbers of transactions. A transaction may refer to token transfer, or even like smart contracts deployment or change state of smart contracts.

### Chaining

Each block is equivalent to a single page in a bank's account ledger; it only represents a slice of the history of the network's history. It's a linked list thats point to previous block and make the data connect to each other. In order to combine these slides into a continuous whole, the blockchain makes use of hash functions. If someone wants to forge the block, they need to find a block with exact same hash value with previous block, or forge all the blocks after the current one.

### Consensus Layer

#### POS

Proof of stake (PoS) is a consensus protocol in blockchains. It is a way to decide which user or users validate new blocks of transactions and earn a reward for doing so correctly. Every transaction and block in the blockchain is digitally signed by its creator. This allows anyone with access to the blockchain to easy validate that every transaction is authenticated.
