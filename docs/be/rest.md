# REST api

### What is rest

The term REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is an architectural style that defines a set of rules in order to create Web Services.

REST suggests to create an object of the data requested by the client and send the values of the object in response to the user. you have an object and you are sending the state of an object. This is why REST is known as Representational State Transfer.
