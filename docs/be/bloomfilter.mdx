# Bloom Filter

Compared to normal hashmap, it has strong space complexity(size) advantage.

For N data

### Normal hashmap

-> N space (each key & value)

### Bloom Filter

function hashkey(x) = hashA(x) + hashB(x) + hashC(x) + ....

write the hash into bit [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0 , 1 , 1 ,0 ,0]

when you need to get the key , exec function again and check if these bits all == 1

The tradeoff is that it could lead false positive(key is not in the data but return true). Cause even though all the required bits == 1, these bits might come from different keys' hash.

False positive probability can be adjusted by size of bits and numbers of hash functions.
