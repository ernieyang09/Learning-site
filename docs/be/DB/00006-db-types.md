# DB types


### RDBMS

These are some of the most common DBMS types. They organize data into structured tables with predefined schemas, using rows and columns. Each table corresponds to an entity, and relationships between entities are established through keys.

Ex: MySQL

### NoSQL

NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making them suitable for handling large amounts of diverse data.

Ex: MongoDB

### In-Memory

These databases store data in main memory (RAM) rather than on disk, allowing for extremely fast data retrieval and processing.

Ex: Redis

### Time-Series

These databases are optimized for handling time-series data, which is data collected over time and indexed by time stamps. They're commonly used in applications like IoT, monitoring, and financial analysis.

Ex: InfluxDB

### NewSQL

NewSQL databases aim to combine the benefits of traditional relational databases with the scalability and flexibility of NoSQL databases. They offer features like distributed architecture while maintaining ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance.

CockroachDB

### Columnar

These databases store data in columns instead of rows, which can improve query performance for analytics and reporting. They are particularly useful for data warehousing and business intelligence.

Ex: Amazon Redshift

### OLAP

OLAP (online analytical processing) is a computing method that enables users to easily and selectively extract and query data in order to analyze it from different points of view.

Ex: Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (OLAP Cube)
