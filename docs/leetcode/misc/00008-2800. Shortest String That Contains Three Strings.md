# 2800. Shortest String That Contains Three Strings

Greedy maybe

Since only a, b, c 3 string, just make permutations and try out all the result

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumString(self, a: str, b: str, c: str) -> str:
        
        res = []
        
        def merge(s1, s2):
            for i in range(len(s1)):
                if s1[i] == s2[0] and s1[i:i+len(s2)] == s2[:len(s1) - i]:
                    return s1 + s2[len(s1) - i:]
            return s1 + s2
        
        for x in permutations([0,1,2], 3):
            current = ''
            for n in x:
                nxt = { 0: a, 1: b, 2: c}[n]
                current = merge(current, nxt)
            res.append(current)
        
        
        res.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
        
        return res[0]
        
```
