# 2806. Account Balance After Rounded Purchase

[link](https://leetcode.com/problems/account-balance-after-rounded-purchase/description/)


```python
class Solution:
    def accountBalanceAfterPurchase(self, purchaseAmount: int) -> int:
        
        num = round(float(purchaseAmount) / 10 + 0.001) * 10

        return 100 - int(num)

```


Care about the round in python

In Python 3, the round() function is used to round a floating-point number to the nearest integer, with ties (e.g., 0.5) being rounded to the nearest even integer. This is also known as "round half to even" or "banker's rounding".

```python
import math

def custom_round(number):
    floor_value = math.floor(number)
    if number - floor_value >= 0.5:
        return math.ceil(number)
    else:
        return floor_value

result = custom_round(0.5)
print(result)  # Output: 1
```
