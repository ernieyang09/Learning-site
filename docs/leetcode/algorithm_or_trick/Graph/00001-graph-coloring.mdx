Make each vertex into different groups, check if they are valid

Pattern

```python
# record each vertex group
G = {}

M = defauldict(list)

# build the graph
for v1, v2 in edges:
    M[v1].append(v2)
    M[v2].append(v1)

# we need to iterate every vertex to find any collision possibility
for i in range(N):
    # if this vertex didn't draw color, then draw
    if i not in G:
        G[i] = 1

    dq = deque([i])

        while dq:
            lens = len(dq)
            for _ in range(lens):
                idx = dq.popleft()

                for ii in M[idx]:
                    if ii not in Groups:
                        # 1 or -1
                        G[ii] = -G[idx]
                        dq.append(ii)
                    elif G[ii] == G[idx]:
                        return False

    return True

```
