# Detect cycle

Floyd's algorithm

Can detect 1. cycle, 2. cycle entry

Use fast, slow pointer, if slow meet fast , then has cycle. Move any pointer to head then move two with one step. When meet = cycle starter.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        slow, fast = head, head
        cycle = False

        while fast and fast.next:

            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

            if slow == fast:
                cycle = True
                break

        if not cycle:
            return None

        fast = head

        # while fast:

        #     care about sequence here
        #     if fast == slow:
        #         return fast

        #     fast = fast.next
        #     slow = slow.next

        # This is better
        while slow != fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next

        return slow
```

Brent's algorithm

Faster than Floyd, but can only detect if there's cycle.

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:

        slow, fast = head, head

        limit = 2

        current = 0

        while fast and fast.next:

            fast = fast.next
            current += 1

            if slow == fast:
                return True

            if current == limit:
                current = 0
                limit *= 2
                slow = fast

        return False
```
