title: Digit DP
---


Most of the time, you will have lower bound and upper bound.

The good solution might be

```python

f(x) => answer for x

ans = f(upper) - f(lower - 1)

```

### How to think of digit dp?

define the function first, you should have at least 2 params

```python
backtrack(lens, tight)
# lens equal to current digit
# tight means if we need to take care of the bound limitation
```
