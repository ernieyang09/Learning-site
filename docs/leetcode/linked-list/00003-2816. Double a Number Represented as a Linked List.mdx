```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:

#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:

        current = head
        
        prev = None
        
        # make it become double linked list
        while current != None:

            current.prev, prev = prev , current
            current = current.next

            if val >= 10:
                extra = 1
                val = val % 10
