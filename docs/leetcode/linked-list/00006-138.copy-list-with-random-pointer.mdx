I write it with two arr

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':

        if not head:
            return None

        arr_o = []
        arr_n = []

        current = head

        while current:
            arr_o.append(current)
            arr_n.append(Node(current.val))
            current = current.next

        for i in range(len(arr_o)):
            if i != len(arr_o) - 1:
                arr_n[i].next = arr_n[i+1]
            if arr_o[i].random:
                idx = arr_o.index(arr_o[i].random)
                arr_n[i].random = arr_n[idx]

        return arr_n[0]
```

However,it seems we can use Node object as dict key

> A dictionaryâ€™s keys are almost arbitrary values. Values that are not hashable, that is, values containing lists, dictionaries or other mutable types (that are compared by value rather than by object identity) may not be used as keys.

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':

        M = { None: None }

        current = head

        while current:
            M[current] = Node(current.val)
            current = current.next

        current = head

        while current:
            M[current].next = M[current.next]
            M[current].random = M[current.random]
            current = current.next

        return M[head]
```
