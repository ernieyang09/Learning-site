My contest version, looks quite similar to other Solution

The key here is to think of "find" var

```python
'''
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbc
1
'''
class Solution:
    def countKSubsequencesWithMaxBeauty(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = Counter(s)

        if k > len(c.values()):
            return 0

        arr = [cc for cc in c.values()]
        arr.sort()

        find = arr[-k]

        res = 1

        while arr[-1] != find:
            res *= arr.pop()
            res %= MOD
            k-= 1

        count = 0

        for i in range(len(arr)-1,-1,-1):
            if arr[i] == find:
                count += 1
            else:
                break

        rr = 1
        for i in range(1, k+1):
            rr *= (count - i + 1)
            rr //= i

        res *= rr

        for i in range(k):
            res *= find
            res %= MOD

        return res
```
